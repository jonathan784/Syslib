Goal: link these together. WordPress, Omeka, and Koha to create a library ecosystem

It has become a general-purpose CMS that can serve as a website builder".

Omeka"is an "open-source web publishing platform for sharing digital collections and creating media-rich online exhibits."

Koha"is an open-source "library management system", otherwise called an integrated library system (ILS). These kinds of systems provide modules that perform specific kinds of functionality. Koha's modules include:
Administration, patron management, cash management, circulation, cataloging, course reserves, serials, acquisitions, reports, and OPAC".
